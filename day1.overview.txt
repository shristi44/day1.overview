electric circuits

computer programming code

In 1961,the first robot was involved :UNIMATE.

Types of Robot:

1.Pre Programmmed  Robot:
perform simple task , its a monotasking robot.

2.Humanoid Robots:
mimics human behaviour excepts physical n biological activities.

3.Autonomous Robots:
performs operations independent of human supervision
ex:vaccum cleaner

4.Telecorperated Robots:
works in extreme weather conditions and mostly used for far away operations.
ex:drones

5.Augmenting Robots:
replaces the human capabilities
ex:robots used for handicapped persons.
